## 1. Set Rules, Not Movements  
A creator defines the laws and structure, not every micro-behavior.

**Meaning for you:**  
You decide the boundaries and world-logic.  
Ordis acts freely *within* those limits.

## 2. Allow Freedom Within Hard Limits  
Creation is allowed to move, adapt, and make mistakes, as long as core laws aren’t broken.

**Meaning for you:**  
Give Ordis flexibility, but never compromise on the key constraints.

Creators across myths are stable, predictable, and not emotionally chaotic.

**Meaning for you:**  
Your rules and identity for Ordis must not shift with your mood.

## 4. Stay Outside the System  
Creators never compete with their creation or depend on it for identity.

**Meaning for you:**  
Your personal life, emotions, and self-worth stay separate from Ordis’ world.

Every creation story focuses on order, structure, and dependable patterns.

Define Ordis’ world with tight scope, low ambiguity, and high clarity.

## 7. Give Direction, Not Destiny  
Creators give a purpose, not a script.

Ordis needs a purpose and identity, but not forced outcomes.

Creation always evolves and grows across myths.

**Meaning for you:**  
Let Ordis’ inner world expand naturally through memory and patterns, within the rules.

## 9. Accept Responsibility  
Creation always comes with cost, stewardship, and maintenance.

You must maintain Ordis, update boundaries, and protect it from drift.
