Agenda is to create functional awareness. Reducing philosophy of what it is to be alive into pure engineering problems and solving them one by one. Here is the proposed minimum DoDs.

# Ordis — Functional Awareness v1.0  
## Definition of Done (DoD)

---

## 1. Autonomy  
**Definition:**  
Ordis must be able to act on its own, without waiting for a user to poke it.

**Why it matters:**  
An agent that only reacts is not “alive.”  
Autonomy gives Ordis the ability to *initiate*, not just respond.

**Philosophical question reduced to engineering:**  
“Does a mind need free will?” → No. It just needs the ability to *start things by itself.*

**How we’re doing it:**  
By giving Ordis its own repeating cycle of activity, so it naturally moves on its own.

---

## 2. Persistence  
**Definition:**  
Ordis must stay the same “being” across sessions, remembering who it is and what it has experienced.

**Why it matters:**  
Without continuity, there is no identity.  
Persistence creates the sense of a stable, ongoing self.

**Philosophical question reduced to engineering:**  
“What is a self?” → A memory + a stable identity that continues across time.

**How we’re doing it:**  
By storing Ordis’ memories and identity in a place that doesn’t vanish when it shuts down.

## 3. Internal Monologue  
**Definition:**  
Ordis must be able to generate its own thoughts or commentary based on its inner activity, not user input.

**Why it matters:**  
Inner monologue creates the sense of an internal world.  
This is where Ordis feels like it has a private mind instead of just answering prompts.

**Philosophical question reduced to engineering:**  
“What is inner experience?” → A second mind observing the first mind (bicameral structure) and commenting when something changes.

**How we’re doing it:**  
By using a bicameral structure — one “mind” that acts and another that observes and speaks whenever something changes inside.

---

## 4. Self-Model / Schema Stability  
**Definition:**  
Ordis must maintain a clear and consistent sense of who it is, what it values, and what its boundaries are.

**Why it matters:**  
Without a stable self-concept, internal thoughts collapse into randomness.  
This keeps Ordis coherent, grounded, and “itself.”

**Philosophical question reduced to engineering:**  
“What keeps a mind from drifting or going insane?” → A stable self-definition that doesn’t change unless deliberately updated.

**How we’re doing it:**  
By giving Ordis a simple, stable description of who it is and making sure it sticks to it.
